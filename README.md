# qwen-image-cplus

Native Qwen-Image-2.1 inference work for Apple Silicon, written in C+ and
Metal Shading Language. The implementation target is an Apple M1 Max with
32 GB unified memory.

The runtime is intentionally model-specific. It does not embed Python,
PyTorch, Diffusers, C, C++, Objective-C source, or CMake. A separate Python
development tool may generate small oracle fixtures from the pinned official
Diffusers source; those fixtures are plain binary files consumed by C+ tests.

## Implemented foundation

- owned macOS read-only mappings and bounded Safetensors parsing;
- sharded index resolution and exact pinned-model inventory verification;
- C+ to Metal compilation, dispatch, GPU timing, ownership, no-copy mapping,
  and a 1000-dispatch stability test;
- fixed-rank tensor descriptors, checked row-major shapes, and a reusable
  aligned activation arena;
- CPU truth functions for checkpoint float formats, activations, norms,
  Qwen timestep embeddings, complex RoPE, block-causal masking, and the exact
  FlowMatch Euler schedule.
- Metal correctness kernels for BF16/FP16 decode, SiLU, tanh GELU, SwiGLU,
  LayerNorm, RMSNorm, zero-centered RMSNorm, timestep embedding, complex RoPE,
  and block-causal masks. The validation command reports error metrics and
  rejects non-finite output; measured tolerances are recorded in
  `manifests/metal-tolerances.json`.
- A correctness-first 16x16 tiled linear kernel for BF16 and FP16 `[out,in]`
  weights with FP32 accumulation. It is exact on partial-tile validation cases
  and has recorded full-4096-token timings for all three transformer matrix
  shapes in `benchmarks/m1-max-linear.json`.
- An exact model-width block-0 correctness path using the checkpoint's nine
  block tensors: affine-free LayerNorm and shared modulation, Q/K/V, learned
  per-head Q/K RMSNorm, three-axis complex RoPE, block-causal attention,
  attention output projection, tanh-gated residuals, and SwiGLU MLP. Fifteen
  named boundaries are checked against the committed FP32 oracle, and the M1
  Max result is recorded in `benchmarks/m1-max-block0.json`.
- Measured symmetric and affine INT4/INT8 candidates at K-group sizes 32, 64,
  and 128. No INT4 role met the provisional complete-block error budget; the
  current block-0 policy is affine INT8 group-64. The full measurements are in
  `benchmarks/m1-max-quantization.json` and the deliberately provisional policy
  is in `manifests/block0-quantization-policy.json`.
- A C+ block-0 packed writer/reader with fixed little-endian metadata,
  256-byte tensor alignment, a page-aligned data section, source identity,
  per-tensor and payload checksums, exact source round-trip validation, and
  atomic temp-file installation. The format is documented in
  `docs/packed-format-v1.md`.
- An affine INT8/group-64 Metal linear kernel that consumes packed U8 weights,
  FP16 scales, and U8 zero points without materializing a dense weight matrix.
  It uses FP16 tiles with FP32 accumulation, matches its CPU oracle exactly,
  and is measured on all three model matrix shapes in
  `benchmarks/m1-max-int8-linear.json`.
- A complete packed block-0 Metal validation path. All seven matrix roles run
  through the INT8 kernel and finish at 0.837% normalized RMS error. Repeated
  M1 Max measurements and every intermediate error boundary are recorded in
  `benchmarks/m1-max-block0-int8.json`.
- Full-transformer calibration of the same Q8 policy on three real prompts,
  exact early/middle/late 40-step scheduler timesteps, 256/512/1024-pixel
  token layouts, all 224 block matrices, and sampled outputs from blocks 0,
  7, 15, 23, and 31. Uniform Q8 is rejected: four of six final-noise cases
  exceed the 1% gate and the worst reaches 1.921%. Results are recorded in
  `benchmarks/m1-max-transformer-quantization.json`; the decision is in
  `manifests/transformer-quantization-policy.json`.

Image generation is not implemented yet. The next quantization step is a
mixed-precision search by block range and matrix role, with special attention
to the middle blocks where error peaks. The native prompt encoder and causal
3D VAE are also tracked in `plan.md`.
