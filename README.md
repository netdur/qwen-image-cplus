# qwen-image-cplus

Native Qwen-Image-2.1 inference work for Apple Silicon, written in C+ and
Metal Shading Language. The implementation target is an Apple M1 Max with
32 GB unified memory.

The runtime is intentionally model-specific. It does not embed Python,
PyTorch, Diffusers, C, C++, Objective-C source, or CMake. A separate Python
development tool may generate small oracle fixtures from the pinned official
Diffusers source; those fixtures are plain binary files consumed by C+ tests.

## Pinned reference

- Model: `Qwen/Qwen-Image-2.1`
- Snapshot: `b3179ad355be050328e483a9dfdd9e60cd62adfa`
- Diffusers commit: `80c7ed262aeffbeb43ef13ae04baeb9b84515a69`
- Machine-readable inventory: `manifests/qwen-image-2.1.json`

## Build and verify

```sh
cpc fmt --check src
cpc check
cpc build
cpc test
./target/debug/qwen-image-cplus probe-stress
./target/debug/qwen-image-cplus test-metal-primitives
./target/debug/qwen-image-cplus test-metal-linear
./target/debug/qwen-image-cplus benchmark-linear
./target/debug/qwen-image-cplus verify-model /path/to/model/snapshot
```

Inspect a shard, optionally filtering tensor names:

```sh
./target/debug/qwen-image-cplus inspect /path/to/shard.safetensors proj_out
```

## Implemented foundation

- owned macOS read-only mappings and bounded Safetensors parsing;
- sharded index resolution and exact pinned-model inventory verification;
- C+ to Metal compilation, dispatch, GPU timing, ownership, no-copy mapping,
  and a 1000-dispatch stability test;
- fixed-rank tensor descriptors, checked row-major shapes, and a reusable
  aligned activation arena;
- CPU truth functions for checkpoint float formats, activations, norms,
  Qwen timestep embeddings, complex RoPE, block-causal masking, and the exact
  FlowMatch Euler schedule.
- Metal correctness kernels for BF16/FP16 decode, SiLU, tanh GELU, SwiGLU,
  LayerNorm, RMSNorm, zero-centered RMSNorm, timestep embedding, complex RoPE,
  and block-causal masks. The validation command reports error metrics and
  rejects non-finite output; measured tolerances are recorded in
  `manifests/metal-tolerances.json`.
- A correctness-first 16x16 tiled linear kernel for BF16 and FP16 `[out,in]`
  weights with FP32 accumulation. It is exact on partial-tile validation cases
  and has recorded full-4096-token timings for all three transformer matrix
  shapes in `benchmarks/m1-max-linear.json`.

Image generation is not implemented yet. The remaining model kernels,
quantized packed format, transformer, native prompt encoder, and causal 3D VAE
are tracked in `plan.md`.
